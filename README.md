plz check dataset if data sent name is different change it to -----> yelp
other dataset names 
1) Yelp1-EDA(preprocessing)
2) Yelp2-EDA(preprocessing)
3) Yelp3-Prediction
4) Yelp4-Result
5) Dataset

this is working on my pc due to the fact GitHub, jupyter notebook and Kaggle are all connected through cloud and game the parent dataset name as yelp
i changed all of it but if it is not working change the name to yelp again
